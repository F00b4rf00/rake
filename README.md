# rake Ñˆ
Powershell script to search and report the drives and directories containing Chia plots below and above 90 GB\
Use this script to ensure all the uncompressed plots have been replotted. The outputs can be used in listing the folders in config.yaml of Chia and by plotsink.exe of Gugahorse farmer to move plots to free drives. Use leafblower.ps1 to delete uncompressed plots on demand.

just run ./rake.ps1
